# How to add a new tool to the list

Please feel free to open a pull request if you know of any podcast that is not
mentioned here. Thanks!  :smiley:

### Requirements

Each podcast should have a link pointing to a playable source, e.g. Spotify,
Apple Podcasts, OverCast or even private sources.

The podcast should be actively maintained in a periodic fashion.

### Format

- Alwqys update the `README.md`, don't add new files that point to it.
- Use the the following format:
```
- [Name of The Podcast](link to website) - Description - [playable source #1](source://source), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/some-podcast).
```
  - If a podcast does not have a website then use the link of one of the
    playable source.
- Please limit the description to no more than **500 characters**.


Finally, create a pull request with all your changes and it will be reviewed as
soon as possible.

**Thanks for helping out!** :tada:
